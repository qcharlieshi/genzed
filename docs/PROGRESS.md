# Genzed Modernization — Progress

Living tracker for the 2017 → 2026 rewrite. Updated as stages land.

- **Design spec:** [docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-25-genzed-modernization-design.md](superpowers/specs/2026-05-25-genzed-modernization-design.md)
- **Stage 1 plan:** [docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-25-stage1-foundation.md](superpowers/plans/2026-05-25-stage1-foundation.md)

## Direction (settled during brainstorming)

| Decision | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| Intent | Living project — invest in a foundation to keep building on |
| Engine | Migrate Phaser 2 → **Phaser 3 + TypeScript** |
| Netcode | **Authoritative server** via Colyseus (server owns the sim) |
| Faithfulness | Preserve original gameplay **1:1** (sprites, weapons, zombies, scoring) |
| Lobby | **React 18**, no Redux — driven by Colyseus room state |
| Hosting | **Fly.io**, single container, single deploy |
| Repo | **pnpm monorepo** (`shared` / `server` / `client`) |

## Staged delivery

| Stage | Scope | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1. Foundation** | Monorepo, server shell, client shell, Docker, Fly, CI, deployable hello-world | ✅ Shipped — live at https://genzed.fly.dev |
| **2. Lobby + room lifecycle** | Name entry, ready states, phase transitions, 2-player minimum, reconnection | ⬜ Not started |
| **3. Movement + rendering** | Tiled map load, server-authoritative movement, client prediction + interpolation | ⬜ Not started |
| **4. Combat** | Weapons, bullets, zombies, damage, pickups, scoring (port tuning from `legacy/`) | ⬜ Not started |
| **5. Polish + playtest** | Tune feel, fix prediction snap, side-by-side parity with the original | ⬜ Not started |

Each stage gets its own spec → plan → build cycle.

## Stage 1 — what shipped

Branch `stage-1-foundation`, 20 commits, PR #1 against `master`.

**Stack swap:**

| Layer | Was (2017) | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Engine | Phaser 2 | Phaser 3.80 |
| Client framework | React 15 + Redux 3 + react-router 3 | React 18 (no Redux) |
| Build | Webpack 2 + Babel 6 + node-sass | Vite 5 + TypeScript 5 |
| Multiplayer | socket.io 1.7 | Colyseus 0.15 |
| Server | Express 4 (JS) | Express 4 + Colyseus (TS, Node 20) |
| Tests | mocha + chai + enzyme | Vitest + Playwright |
| Deploy | Heroku | Fly.io (Docker) |

**Structure:** `shared/` (tick constants), `server/` (Express + Colyseus `ArenaRoom`, `/healthz`), `client/` (Vite + React + Phaser `HelloScene`). Original 2017 code archived under `legacy/`.

**Behavior:** a browser loads the React shell, a Phaser `HelloScene` mounts, connects to the Colyseus `ArenaRoom` over WebSocket, and renders `connected: <sessionId>`. Server is authoritative-ready (clients will send inputs, not positions).

**Single-container model:** multi-stage Dockerfile (241 MB) where the Colyseus server also serves the built client bundle on one port. Fly's proxy terminates TLS and forwards the WebSocket upgrade on the same port. No CORS, no second service.

## Verification (Stage 1)

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm typecheck` | ✅ clean across all 3 packages |
| `pnpm lint` | ✅ clean |
| `pnpm test` | ✅ 2 server tests (healthz, ArenaRoom join) |
| `pnpm test:e2e` | ✅ Playwright smoke (canvas mounts, connects, no console errors) |
| `pnpm dev` (browser) | ✅ canvas shows `connected: <id>` — screenshot `docs/stage1-evidence/stage1-dev-verify.png` |
| `pnpm build` + prod server (browser) | ✅ same on one port — `docs/stage1-evidence/stage1-prod-verify.png` |
| `docker build` + `docker run` | ✅ `/healthz`=ok, client bundle served, Colyseus listening |
| `fly deploy` | ✅ live at https://genzed.fly.dev — screenshot `docs/stage1-evidence/stage1-fly-verify.png` |

## Outstanding (Stage 1)

- [ ] **CI auto-deploy:** add `FLY_API_TOKEN` as a GitHub repo secret (`fly tokens create deploy --expiry 8760h`).
- [ ] **Merge PR #1** once CI is green.

## Operational notes

- App `genzed` runs **1 shared-cpu-1x machine** in `sjc`. Fly's default is 2 for HA; scaled down because Colyseus seat reservations live in-process — matchmaking POST + WS upgrade must land on the same VM. Subsequent `fly deploy` runs preserve the count.
- Real HA later means a Redis-backed Colyseus presence so reservations survive cross-VM.

## Notable build gotchas (resolved)

- **`@genzed/shared` resolution.** Source-first exports (`./src/index.ts`) work for Vite/tsx but the compiled Node server can't load `.ts` — switched shared to `dist`-first exports and added a `prepare` script so `pnpm install` builds `shared/dist/` on a fresh clone.
- **Docker incremental-build cache.** A stale `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` copied into the build context made `tsc` (composite) skip emit, so `shared/dist/` was never produced. Fixed by adding `**/*.tsbuildinfo` to `.dockerignore` and sequencing the package builds (shared → server → client).

## Known sharp edges for Stage 2

- **`ArenaRoom.onLeave`** deletes the player immediately. Stage 2 should use `allowReconnection()` + a grace period so a page refresh doesn't drop someone from the lobby.
- **`fly.toml` `min_machines_running = 0`** + `auto_stop_machines` will kill in-flight games. Bump to `1` once there's real session state.
- **Client/server Colyseus version skew** (`colyseus.js@0.15.26` vs server `@0.15.57`) — both resolve `@colyseus/schema@2.0.37` so the wire protocol matches today, but align before wire-protocol work in Stage 3.
- **`game.scene.start()` called synchronously** after `new Phaser.Game()` relies on implicit queueing; switch to the `ready` event when the scene lifecycle becomes real.
